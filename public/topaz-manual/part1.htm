 <h2>FOREWORD</h2>
 <b><p>This Management Simulation is based on a realistic business situation,
    in which a number of virtual companies, represented by the teams taking part, 
    compete against one another within a common business environment.
 </p>
 <p>A complex computer model simulates -
  </p><ul>
    <li>the interactions of the various parts of each company</li>
    <li>the competitive relationships between the companies</li>
    <li>and the background economic situation.</li>
  </ul>
  Your task is to manage one of these companies as if it were a real business.
 <p></p>

   <li>How to take part</li> 
   <li>The organisation of the simulation/competition</li>
   <li>What your team must do</li>
   <li>How your company works, and how it relates to the other companies in your group.</li>

 <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

 <p>Your company can be considered to have four main management functions -
   </p><ol>
     <li>Marketing</li>
     <li>Operations</li>
     <li>Personnel</li>
     <li>Finance</li>
   </ol>
 <p></p>
 <p>One of the main aims of this simulation is to illustrate 
    the interactions between these four functions.
 </p>
 <p>Emphasis is placed on the importance of achieving a good balance 
    in order to achieve your objectives.
 </p>
 <p>This can best be achieved by good organisation, effective communication and teamwork.
    Therefore, you should     
   <a href="guidance.htm">organise</a> 
   (see Guidance Note) your team to carry out the duties of senior management.
 </p>
 <p>Control of your company is exercised through two documents: 
 </p><dl>
 <dt>The Management Report</dt>
 <dd>This shows your company performance in the quarter just completed. </dd>
 <dt>The Decision Form</dt>
 <dd>The printed sheet, or computer screen in which you make decisions for next quarter.</dd>
 </dl>
 <p></p>
<br id="O">
 <h3>Objective</h3>
 <p>You are trying to win by maximising your company's prospects for 
    the future so that, at the end of the simulation, your company has the 
    highest share price.
 </p>
 <p>To achieve this target you need to develop a 
   <a href="guidance.htm#strat" title="Guidance note">company strategy</a> 
   (see Guidance Note).
 </p>
 <p>Once you have a strategy you can work out the tactics to make 
    that strategy happen.
 </p>
<br id="H">
 <h3>Company History</h3>
 <p>You are given a brief history of your company covering  
    the period immediately before the simulation starts, 
    including the decisions which generated these results.
 </p>
 <p>This history consists of the Management Reports for several quarters (usually five).
   All companies taking part have the same history,  
   so that each starts from an identical position.
 </p>
 <p>The following sample report is taken from history GM05.
    You may find it helpful to refer to it, occasionally, while reading this manual.
 </p>
 <p>Right clicking the link below will enable you to open it in a new tab or window -
 </p>
 <p>���<a href="../history/GM05Y06Q3.htm">2006Q3</a> 
</p>

 <p>The contents of the Management Report are described in detail elsewhere 
   (see Index at left)
 </p>
<br id="P">
 <h3>Procedure</h3>
 <p>Having assessed the situation and decided what you want to do, 
    complete your first Decision Form and submit it for processing, 
    in accordance with the published timetable. In return you will 
    receive a Management Report which tells you what has happened 
    to your company as a result of the decisions you have taken. 
    Use this information to improve your knowledge of the workings 
    of your company and of the market. Then make the next set of 
    decisions ... and so on to the end of the simulation.<br>
 </p>
 <br id="A">
 <h3>Additional points</h3>
 <p>Before proceeding to the rest of the Manual, there are several 
    points which need to be explained:
 </p><ul>
  <li>Some companies have been known to make large losses. 
      Even so, you will never be declared bankrupt. 
      By permitting companies to continue to operate on massive borrowings, 
      which might not be tolerated in real life, all teams taking 
      part are at least able to reach the end.</li>
  <li>The simulation proceeds in steps of 
      one <a href="more.htm#Q" title="Definitions">quarter</a> of a calendar year. 
      Once decisions have been taken for the coming quarter 
      they cannot be altered before the next. 
      The simulation consists of a number of quarters (which will 
      be announced before the simulation starts), and you are given a timetable 
      detailing when Decisions must be sent in for processing, and 
      when you should receive the resulting Management Report.</li>
  <li>During the course of the simulation the Controller
      does not intervene in any way to affect its development.
      All economic data (market trends, interest rates, etc.)
      are set before the simulation begins.
      The simulation Controller never arbitrarily interferes.
      There is sufficient uncertainty created by the interactions
      of the competing companies, without adding any more.</li>
  <li>To help you make effective use of this Manual, hyperlinks
      are provided in the Contents list (see left) to the major sections.
      Costs and other fixed parameters are included in a series of tables. 
      These may be accessed from relevant links.  
      There are also many cross-references, 
      plus additional guidance and notes on important detail.</li> 
 </ul>
